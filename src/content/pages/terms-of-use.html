                <h2 style="color: white;">11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Informal Negotiations</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a <strong>\"Dispute\"</strong>), the parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration or court proceedings. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other.
                </p>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    If informal negotiations do not resolve the Dispute, either party may elect to resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration administered by a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator located within Cumberland County, PA. Arbitration shall be conducted in English, and the arbitratorâ€™s decision shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p><br>

                <h style="color: white;"3>Restrictions</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The parties agree that any arbitration or litigation shall be limited solely to the Dispute between the parties individually. To the extent permitted by law, no arbitration or litigation shall be joined with any other proceeding or conducted on a class-action basis.
                </p>

                <h3 style="color: white;">Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect intellectual property rights; (b) any claim related to allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) claims for injunctive relief. Such Disputes shall be resolved exclusively by the courts of Cumberland County, PA.
